# VHDL-Chess
By Lutulu Mbiye

This Project is partial recreation of the game of Chess for the Nexys 4 Atrix-7 Board.

This Game Includes all the chess pieces and each one is bound to the proper movements.

This doesn't includes Castleing, Check/Checkmate/Stalemate, En passant, or turn order. Pawns will auto promote to Queens.

This Project was compiled using Xilinx ISE 14.7. It includes the constraint file, A bitstream, and all the VHDLs. When generating it would take about 3 hours to finish.
